# Introduction

>This small project uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search and show movies based on a user input query.

# Getting started

Clone the repository here: [SiriusDreamz]

- Open you CLI of choise (for example [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/): and navigate to where you cloned the project.
- In the command line interface, run (npm will run $ npm install as a dependency on $ npm start to make sure the dependencies are installed):
    ```sh
    $ npm start
    ```
- Open your browser (for this project I recommend Google Chrome), and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

> Troubleshooting: If the the address (http://localhost:8000) is in use the CLI will throw an error. Make sure the address is free to use, and then run $ npm start again.

### Tech

* [AngularJS]
* [Bootstrap]
* [SCSS]
* [GIT]

>This project is build around the AngularJS framework. Other than that, the project was build on the technologies above. Also only vanilla JavaScript and angular syntax was used to keep unecessary syntax/technologies out of the way. The styling and responsiveness is achieved by basic scss and bootstrap, including the use of [flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp). [GitBash] has been used as the version control system.

### Limitations
- A limit of 10 hits per query.
